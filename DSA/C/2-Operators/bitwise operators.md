###### they work at bits, it means there operands are bits.

> - negative value(integer) store in memory in the form of 2's complement of its +ve version. or negative number binary = it's 2's complement.
> - in binary format, left most number is most significant bit (sign bit) which tells us whether the number is positive or negative (1 -> -ve and 0 -> +ve).

### right shift operator (>>) & left shift operator (<<)


>[!info]+ right shift
>Right Shift(>>) is a binary operator that takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift.


>[!info]+ left shift
> The left shift(<<) is a binary operator that takes two numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift.
