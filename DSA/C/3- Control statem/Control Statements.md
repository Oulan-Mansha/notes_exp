-  with the help of these statements we can decide which line should be execute and which line should be skipped (or we can say, we can choose in which processor's control should go).
- we can change the sequential flow of execution of the program.
- for instance ; 1,2,3,4,5 are the lines 1 and 2 has been after executed instead of executing 3rd instruction we want that 5th instruction should be execute, we can achieve it.

>[!tip]- note
> - if-else is a one statement,means it runs a same time, whereas two if are two statements,which runs at different times.
> - if we do not write curly brackets after if statement then only 1 very next statement will be include in its block and if we write more than one line before else then else will not be remain the part of if and else is nothing alone(without if), it will cause an error; same for else statement.

>[!tip]- imp
> - to write multiple lines in conditional operator, separate them with comma.
> - expression is something which leave a single result after evaluating that why we can assign value of conditional operator to a variable but not the if-else(it is a statement).

>[!tip]- imp about if-else-ladder
> - it is technically only one statement
> - it will increase the readability
> - it is just the special case of nested if else, in which we are doing nesting in else.
> - we will use it, if we have more choices and we have to choose only one option
